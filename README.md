App created to study and practice ReactJs. 
The app is based on the application developed during the React course by Inter Bank - Semana Front-end Inter.
One part of course was focused to develop the backend of the application, although I focused here is on the front, then the backend requests are mock on the front using the JSON server package.
There are some adpations but the major applications was developed following the course steps.
